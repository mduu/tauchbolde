# tauchbolde
Next generation website fro http://tauchbolde.ch

This is the code for the upcoming Tauchbolde Website. The current website is built using Drupal 7. Its not bad it has several downsides.
So the new website is a complete rewrite in C# / ASP.Net Core - a custom development.

## Primary goals

* Back to basics
* Easy maintainance
* No permanent security updates (unlike the current Drupal based website)
* Adding the exacly the functionality needed - not more not less
* Playing with new tech like .Net Core / ASP.Net Core and later on Mobile Apps, Web-Tech like React etc.

## Current state

The first version is still under development. Its a run-though go get the new website online as soon as possible. But its all done I the
spare free time so it may take a while until you will see this online.
